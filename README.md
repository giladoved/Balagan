Balagan
=======

Balagan is an educational game aimed at teaching the correct order of the Hebrew alphabet. The letters appear scattered on the screen and the child needs to tap the alphabet, one letter at a time, in the correct order. The game will let you know right away if your choice was correct or not by giving off a light buzz if the answer was wrong. The child has an unlimited number of clicks until all the letters are arranged in the correct order. This game is compatible with any phone running the Android operating system. I would love to get feedback and requests for improvements.
